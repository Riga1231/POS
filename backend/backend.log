(node:10980) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Projects/electron/POS/backend/server.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\Projects\electron\POS\backend\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
